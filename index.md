# Welcome to the 3dverse Devlog

**Building the future of real-time 3D, one triangle at a time.**

---

## 👋 Hey, I'm Houssem.

This is my blog, chronicling the journey of building a cloud-native, collaborative 3D engine from scratch—using nothing but C++, Vulkan, and a little stubbornness.

### What you'll find here:
- **Deep dives** into low-level graphics programming with Vulkan
- Stories from the trenches of modern C++ development
- Adventures (and misadventures) with cloud infrastructure for real-time apps
- Insights on making high-performance, scalable 3D engines
- Lessons learned, performance tricks, design failures, and breakthroughs
- Open discussions, code snippets, diagrams, and maybe some war stories

## 🚀 Why this blog?

I started with a simple goal: draw a single triangle on the screen, from scratch.  
It spiraled into a full platform—3dverse—supporting real-time collaboration, massive scenes, live ray tracing, scripting, and more.

If you're into graphics, game engines, cloud tech, or just want a peek behind the scenes as something wild gets built… you’re in the right place.
